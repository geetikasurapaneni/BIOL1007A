I chose a paper by Bowden et al. (2015). The study used a 17-year dataset on wing lengths of two butterfly species in Greenland to show that both species follow the “temperature-size” rule, which posits that higher temperatures generally select for smaller adult body size.

I got the data from dryad: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.43gt3  

The figure I am trying to recreate:
