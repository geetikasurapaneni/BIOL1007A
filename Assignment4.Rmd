1. This is Question 1: 

```{r}
n_dims  <- round(runif(1, min = 3, max = 10))
print(n_dims)

z <- seq(1:n_dims^2)
print(z)

sample(z)

m <-  matrix(data=z, nrow = n_dims, byrow = TRUE)
print(m)
  
transposed_m <- t(m)
print(transposed_m)

sum(transposed_m[1,])
sum(transposed_m[n_dims,])
mean(transposed_m[1,])
mean(transposed_m[n_dims,])
```
